<h1>Operators in C++</h1>
<hr>
<p>An operator is a symbol that tells the compiler to perform specific mathematical or logical manipulations. C++ is rich in built-in operators and provides the following types of operators:</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Arithmetic Operators</p></li>
<li><p>Relational Operators</p></li>
<li><p>Logical Operators</p></li>
<li><p>Bitwise Operators</p></li>
<li><p>Assignment Operators</p></li>
<li><p>Misc Operators</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This chapter will examine the arithmetic, relational, logical, bitwise, assignment and other operators one by one.</p>
<h2>Arithmetic Operators</h2>
<p>There are following arithmetic operators supported by C++ language:</p>
<p>Assume variable A holds 10 and variable B holds 20, then:</p>

<table class="table table-bordered">

<tr><td>--</td><td> <a>title="Decrement operator in C++">Decrement operator</a>, decreases integer value by one</td><td> A-- will give 9</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<h2>Relational Operators</h2>
<p>There are following relational operators supported by C++ language</p>
<p>Assume variable A holds 10 and variable B holds 20, then:</p>

<p><a> title="Relational Operators in C++">Show Examples</a></p>

<h2>Logical Operators</h2>
<p>There are following logical operators supported by C++ language</p>
<p>Assume variable A holds 1 and variable B holds 0, then:</p>
<p><a>title="Logical Operators in C++">Show Examples</a></p>
<table class="table table-bordered">
<tbody><tr><th width="10%">Operator</th><th width="45%">Description</th><th>Example</th></tr>
<tr><td>&amp;&amp;</td><td> Called Logical AND  operator. If both the operands are non-zero, then condition becomes true.</td><td> (A &amp;&amp; B) is false. </td></tr>
<tr><td>||</td><td>Called Logical OR Operator.  If any of the two operands is non-zero, then condition becomes true.</td><td> (A || B) is true. </td></tr>
<tr><td>!</td><td>Called Logical NOT Operator.  Use to reverses the logical state of its operand. If a condition is true, then Logical NOT operator will make false.</td><td> !(A &amp;&amp; B) is true. </td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<h2>Bitwise Operators</h2>
<p>Bitwise operator works on bits and perform bit-by-bit operation. The truth tables for &amp;, |, and ^ are as follows:</p>
<table class="table table-bordered">
<tbody><tr><th>p</th><th>q</th><th>p&amp;q</th> <th>p|q</th> <th>p^q</th></tr>
<tr><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr>
<tr><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>Assume if A = 60; and B = 13; now in binary format they will be as follows:</p>
<p>A = 0011 1100</p>
<p>B = 0000 1101</p>
<p>-----------------</p>
<p>A &amp; B = 0000 1100</p>
<p> A|B = 0011 1101</p>
<p> A^B = 0011 0001</p>
<p> ~A&nbsp; = 1100 0011</p>
<p>The Bitwise operators supported by C++ language are listed in the following table. Assume variable A holds 60 and variable B holds 13, then:</p>
<p><a>title="Bitwise Operators in C++">Show Examples</a></p>

<table class="table table-bordered">
<tbody><tr><th width="20%">Operator</th><th width="60%">Description</th><th>Example</th></tr>
<tr><td>&amp;</td><td> Binary AND Operator copies a bit to the result if it exists in both operands. </td><td> (A &amp; B) will give 12 which is 0000 1100</td></tr>
<tr><td>|</td><td> Binary OR Operator copies a bit if it exists in either operand. </td><td> (A | B) will give 61 which is 0011 1101</td></tr>
<tr><td>^</td><td> Binary XOR Operator copies the bit if it is set in one operand but not both. </td><td> (A ^ B) will give 49 which is 0011 0001</td></tr>
<tr><td>~</td><td> Binary Ones Complement Operator is unary and has the effect of 'flipping' bits. </td><td>(~A ) will give -61 which is 1100 0011 in 2's complement form due to a signed binary number.</td></tr>
<tr><td>&lt;&lt;</td><td> Binary Left Shift Operator. The left operands value is moved left by the number of bits specified by the right operand. </td><td> A &lt;&lt; 2 will give 240 which is 1111 0000</td></tr>

</tbody></table>
<h2>Misc Operators</h2>
<p>There are few other operators supported by C++ Language.</p>
<table class="table table-bordered">
<tbody><tr><th width="20%">Operator</th><th width="45%">Description</th></tr>
<tr><td>sizeof</td><td><a>sizeof operator</a> returns the size of a variable. For example, sizeof(a), where a is integer, will return 4.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Condition ? X : Y</td><td><a>Conditional operator</a>. If Condition is true ? then it returns value X : otherwise value Y</td></tr>
<tr><td>,</td><td><a>Comma operator</a> causes a sequence of operations to be performed. The value of the entire comma expression is the value of the last expression of the comma-separated list.</td></tr>
<tr><td>. (dot) and  -&gt; (arrow)</td><td><a>Member operators</a> are used to reference individual members of classes, structures, and unions.</td></tr>
<tr> <td>Cast</td><td><a>Casting operators</a> convert one data type to another. For example, int(2.2000) would return 2.</td></tr>
<tr><td>&amp;</td><td><a>Pointer operator &amp;</a> returns the address of an variable. For example &amp;a; will give actual address of the variable.</td></tr>
<tr><td>*</td><td><a>Pointer operator *</a> is pointer to a variable. For example *var; will pointer to a variable var.</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<h2>Operators Precedence in C++</h2>
<p>Operator precedence determines the grouping of terms in an expression. This affects how an expression is evaluated. Certain operators have higher precedence than others; for example, the multiplication operator has higher precedence than the addition operator:</p>
<p>For example x = 7 + 3 * 2; here, x is assigned 13, not 20 because operator * has higher precedence than +, so it first gets multiplied with 3*2 and then adds into 7.</p>
 <p>Here, operators with the highest precedence appear at the top of the table, those with the lowest appear at the bottom. Within an expression, higher precedence operators will be evaluated first.</p>
