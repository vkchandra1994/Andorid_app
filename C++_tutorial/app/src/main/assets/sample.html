<h3>
 <p> The C++ programming language has a history going back to 1979,when Bjarne Stroustrup was doing work for his Ph.D. thesis.
        C++ is a object-oriented programming language and is considerd to be an extension of C.
        It is devloped by Bjarne Stroustrup at AT and T Bell Laboratories,Murray Hill,New Jerey(USA).
        Stroustrup,a master of Simula67 and C,wanted to combine the features
        of both the languages into a more powerful language that could support object-oriented programming with features of C.
        Various ideas are derived from SIMULA67 and ALGOL68.Stroustrup called the new language C with classes.
        However ,in 1983 the name was changed to
        C++.The thought of C++ came from the C increment operator ++.
        Rick Mascitti coined the term C++ in 1983.Therefore C++ is an extended version of C.</p>
