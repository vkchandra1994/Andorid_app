<h3>What is C++</h3>
		  C++ is a general purpose, case-sensitive, free-form programming language that supports object-oriented,
procedural and generic programming.C++ is a middle-level language, as it encapsulates both high and low level language features.
<div class="heading">Advantage and Disadvantage of C++ and Scope</div>
<p><i>Advantage of C++ are:</i></p>
<ul>
	<li>C++ use multi-paradigm programming. 
	Paradigm means style of programming .paradigm concerned about logics , 
	structure and procedure of program. C++ is multi-paradigm means it follow 
	three paradigm Generic, Imperative, Object Oriented.</li>
	<li>It is useful for low level programming language and very efficient for general purpose.</li>
	<li>C++ provide performance and memory efficiently.</li>
	<li>It provide high level abstraction. </li>
	<li>in the language of the problem domain.</li>
	<li>C++ is compatible with C.</li>
	<li>C++ used reusability of code.</li>
	<li>C++ used inheritance, polymorphism.</li>
</ul>
<p><i>Disadvantage of C++ are:</i></p>
<ul>
	<li>Complex in very large high level program.</li>
	<li>Used for platform specific application commonly.</li>
	<li>For a particular operating system or platform the library set is usually chosen that locks.</li>
	<li>when C++ used for web applications complex and difficult to debug.</li>
   <li>C++ can't support garbage collection.</li>
	<li>C++ not support Dynamic Memory Allocation.</li>
	<li>C++ is not secure because it have pointer, friend function and global variable.</li>
	<li>No support for threads built in.</li>
</ul>

<p><i>Scope of the C++ are:</i></p>
<ul>
	<li>C++ use with object oriented programming.</li>
	<li>C++ used object where object are real time entities.</li>
	<li>C++ used class ,is a container of objects.</li>
	<li>C++ provide reusability of codes.</li>
	<li>In C++ , functions and variable can acquire the feature&nbsp; of its parents.</li>
	<li>In C++, function can be overloaded and override.</li>
	<li>C++ can use encapsulation.&nbsp;</li>
	</ul>
